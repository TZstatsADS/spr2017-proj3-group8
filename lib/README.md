The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

+ Random_Forest_PCA: 

This folder contains random forest training function, test function, random forest with cross-validation  function and also the main.R for evaluating random forest model.

+ gbm
This folder contains training function, test function, cross validation function for Gradient Boosting Machine model, as well as the main.R for evaluation the model

+ PCA.R
Extract pca features from SIFT features.

+ Conv_Neural_Net
This folder contains training, test and cross validation function for Convoluted Neural Network model. 

+ Neural_Net
This folder contains training, test and cross validation function for Neural Network model. 

+ HOG_feature.R
Extract hog features and combine it with SIFT features.

+ extract_feature.R
Read in raw images and output pixels for certain width and height, to be used in CNN model.
