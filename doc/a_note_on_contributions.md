### A Note on Contributions

Project: Labradoodle or Fried Chicken?

Team members: Ken Chew, Sean Reddy, Yifei Lin, Yini Zhang, Yue Jin.

Summary: In this project, we implemented the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest and Neural Network to generate a classification engine for grayscale images of poodles versus images of fried chickens. To further improve the prediction performance, besides the provided SIFT descriptors, we also used Histogram of Oriented Gradients descriptors to train the model. 

[Contribution Statement] Yue Jin developed baseline classification model for evaluation. Yifei Lin and Yini Zhang explored feature engineering for improving the baseline model. Yue Jin, Yini Zhang and Sean Reddy designed the model evaluation protocol and carried out the computation for model evaluation. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository. Yue Jin organized and documented the GitHub repository. Yifei Lin prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
