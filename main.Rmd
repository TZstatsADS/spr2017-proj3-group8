## **Project Description**

### Term
* Spring 2017

###Team 
* Group 8

### Team Members   
* Ken Chew  
* Yue Jin  
* Yifei Lin  
* Sean Reddy  
* Yini Zhang  

### Project Summary
* In this project, we implemented majority vote with Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest, Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate a classification engine for grayscale images of poodles versus images of fried chickens. 
* To further improve the prediction performance, besides the provided SIFT descriptors, we also used Histogram of Oriented Gradients descriptors to train the model.






## **Baseline Model (GBM + Sift)**
Tuned Parameters are: Depth = 5

Methology: Cross Validation with different depth

Depth | Error Rate 
------------- | ------------- 
5 | 0.2355

## **Improved Model**
### Feature
* In addition to 5000 sift features, we used Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method to generate 448 extra new features   
* HOG + a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection + it counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image + it is computed on a dense grid of uniformly spaced cells and uses overlapping local contrast normalization for improved accuracy

### Model 
* Majority Vote with GBM, random forest, neural network and convolutional neural network
